CHAPTER VI.

CONCLUSION.


We have endeavored to show how the faculty of abstracting and of
generalising has been developed empirically, and to follow it in its
spontaneous and natural evolution as shown in history,—not in the
philosophical speculations which are only its efflorescence, and which,
for the most part, ignore or despise its origins. It remains to us,
in conclusion, to seek out how, and by what causes, this intellectual
process has constituted and developed itself: further—what are the
different directions it has followed in the course of its development.

I. To contemporary psychology, the mind is a sum of processes of
dissimilar nature, whose mode of appearance and of evolution depends
upon predetermined conditions. In the total of intellectual operations,
abstraction is a process of secondary formation: it does not belong
to the primary stratum of sensations and percepts, of appetites and
tendencies, of primitive emotions. We found however that it was there in
embryo. How then, instead of remaining in this rudimentary state, has it
been so differentiated as to become a function proper to the intellect,
and with a long development that is still in progress?

The primary condition is the existence of _attention_, which brings a few
points into relief, amid the general confusion. We have shown elsewhere
that attention itself depends originally upon the instinct of individual
preservation.[136] Attention, however, can only precede and prepare
for abstraction, because it is a momentary state of application to the
variable aspects of events, and does not isolate anything.

We know how the first labor of separation, of dissociation, takes effect
in the formation of generic images, and how the extracted quality
_fixed_ itself, for better or worse, by the aid of a visual, auditory,
tactile scheme, by a movement, a gesture, which confers on it a sort of
independence.

Finally, with the word—the substitute for the abstract intuition—the
mental dissociation approximates to a real dissociation: the abstract
character, incarnated in the word, seems, as happens only too often, to
exist by itself. The process of abstraction, with its fitting instrument,
is completely constituted.

During these successive phases, and afterwards, throughout the course
of the historical development of human intelligence, the progress of
abstraction and of generalisation, depends upon two principal causes: one
general, i. e., utility; the other accidental and sporadic, the advent of
inventors.

I. In his book on _Darwinism_ (Ch. XV.) Wallace, in contesting the
theory that applies the law of conservation of variations, useful in
the struggle for existence, to the mental faculties, insists at length
upon the mathematical faculty; he maintains that it is an inexplicable
exception, a case that cannot be reduced to law. The inaptitude of
inferior races for even the simplest calculations is well known;
how—from such a rudimentary origin—could it develop into the genius of
a Newton, a Laplace, or a Gauss? What motive power accounts for this
development? The author establishes by a host of sufficiently useless
historical details, that mathematical superiority played no part in the
struggle of tribe with tribe, and later on of people with people (Greeks
against Persians), and that the victory resulted from other causes, moral
and social. For this there is abundant evidence. But since mathematical
aptitude is only a particular instance of abstraction, albeit one of the
most perfect, the question ought to be proposed under a more general
form. Had the aptitude for abstraction, _ab initio_, any practical value?
Yes, “the motive power that caused its development, that Wallace claims
without specifying it, is utility.”

To avoid possibility of equivocation, let us remark that the development
of the attitude for abstracting and generalising may be explained in
a two-fold manner: by acknowledging the influence of heredity, and by
omitting it.

In the former case, it is supposed that this aptitude appears as a
“spontaneous variation” in the individual or race, that it fixes itself,
is reciprocal, grows by slow accumulation in the course of generations.
This theory postulates the heredity of acquired characters, which is
accepted by some, rejected by others, more especially since the advent of
Weismann. I refrain from invoking it, by reason of its hypothetical and
disputed nature. The probability of any transmission would moreover be
far harder to establish here than in other psychical directions, such as
imagination, or feeling.

In the second case, with elimination of the hereditary factor, progress
must be attributed to social causes, utility and imitation. From all time
there have been minds which when face to face with practical problems
knew better than others how to extract the essential, and neglect the
accessory, in the complex of facts. The utility of abstraction is
identical with that of attention, which does not require demonstration;
it may be summed up in a single word: to simplify. As the process
succeeds, it finds imitators. There is no need to admit at the outset
any reflected and fully conscious abstraction: a happy instinct, guided
by the needs of life, is sufficient at the commencement. Races that
are poorly gifted in this respect, or little apt at imitating their
betters, have never got beyond a low level. In effect, abstraction and
generalisation are the nerve of all knowledge that transcends sensation.
Is this mode of cognition useful? There can be no possible doubt as to
the answer.

2. The rôle of inventors corresponds to the fact which, in transformist
terminology, is known as spontaneous variation. By inventors, we mean
those who are born with the talent or the genius for abstraction. It
is superfluous to prove that such have been found, in considerable
numbers. They are abstract thinkers by instinct, as others are musicians,
mechanicians, designers. The biography of the great mathematicians
abounds in examples: Pascal inventing geometry out of a few vague
indications from his father; Newton divining Euclid’s demonstrations
from the simple enunciation of the theorems; Ampère, before he could
read or understand the use of figures, making long calculations by means
of a few pebbles; Gauss, at five years old, rectifying the arithmetic
of a workman, etc. If fewer analogous facts can be quoted from the
other sciences, it is because mathematical precocity is frequent, and
is more surprising. All that is the effect of innate disposition: this
word serving only to recapitulate our ignorance of the causes which
produce such minds. In the development of knowledge by abstraction and
generalisation, the first cause—utility—may be likened to the part played
by slow actions in geology; whether in the case of practical inventions,
or of the constitution of an idiom, it is continuous, collective, and
anonymous. The rôle of the great abstract thinkers, on the contrary,
resembles the rapid and epoch-making actions.

II. If we now consider the progress of abstraction from a more general
point of view (instead of following it step by step, from its lowest
to its highest degree, as in the preceding chapters), i. e., according
to its orientation towards a given end, we find that it has followed
three principal directions during its history: practical, speculative,
scientific. These are, indeed, inseparable, inasmuch as practical
abstraction leads to science, scientific abstraction is profitable to
practice, and speculation cannot entirely forego the other two.[137]

Abstraction and practical generalisation are necessarily the first in
order, as we found in studying their first appearance in the lower
animals, in children, and in savages. They serve to distinguish the
qualities of things by some word, or sign; they subserve the simple
adaptations of daily life. Later on, at a higher stage, they note the
appearance of mixed processes, which, while more especially directed to
utility, are already the prelude to scientific knowledge. Disinterested
curiosity has awakened, and timidly makes for daylight. A minimum
acquaintance with the history of the sciences teaches us that all were at
their origin processes of _applied_ research, and that often, in their
uncertain efforts, our forbears found what they were not looking for. The
numerative systems issued from the need of counting objects, and later
on, from rude commercial exchanges. Elementary geometry was required,
in order to measure the fields, to determine a right angle, to fix
relative positions, and to furnish the indispensable parts of primitive
architecture. The invention of the lever, of the balance, of rudimentary
engines for the lifting of heavy masses, gave the first foundations of
mechanics. Astronomy arose in the desire to regulate civil life and
the religious festivals, and the wish (e. g., among the Peruvians and
Mexicans) not to irritate the gods by delaying the sacrifices due to
them. Metallurgy, and later on the search for the philosopher’s stone,
and the elixir of life, were the prelude to scientific chemistry. The
historical outset of each science would furnish a profusion of similar
facts.

The two other operations issued by an internal division of labor from
this—at first the only—tendency of the mind.

First come purely speculative, i. e., philosophical or metaphysical
abstraction and generalisation. This new trend has clean and well defined
characteristics; and it was, in antiquity, the privilege of two peoples
alone, the Greeks and the Hindus. Abstraction leads immediately to the
highest generalisations; from the crude and direct simplification of a
few facts, the mind leaps at a bound to the final causes of things;
it skips the intermediate stages: it ignores the sequence of slow
and progressive evolution. This procedure where, in point of fact,
abstraction and generalisation are only the servants of a particular form
of imagination, found its first complete expression in Plato, and the
Theory of Ideas. With Plato, the human intellect tasted for the first
time the supreme pleasures of playing with the highest abstractions,
and believing firmly that the universe can be summed up, constructed
and explained by the help of some few entities. In this direction,
notwithstanding its manifold changes of aspect, the generalising process
has remained fundamentally the same, and has done no more than repeat
itself. We are here concerned with statement, not with criticism.
Psychologists must needs admit that this tendency to construct the world
(whether or no it be illusory) is a fact inherent in the nature of the
human intellect. Stallo, in the book already quoted,[138] gives an
incisive critique of the fundamental concepts of the physical sciences,
and their unconscious trend towards metaphysics. His appreciation of the
characteristics proper to the purely speculative process of abstraction
and generalisation is so apt, that we cannot do better than transcribe it:

    “Whatever diversity may exist between metaphysical systems,
    they are all founded upon the express or implied supposition
    that there is a fixed correspondence between concepts and
    their filiations on the one hand and things and their mode
    of interdependence on the other. This fundamental error is
    in great part due to a delusory view of the function of
    language as an aid to the formation and fixation of concepts.
    Roughly stated, concepts are the meanings of words; and the
    circumstances that words primarily designate things, or at
    least objects of sensation and their sensible interactions,
    has given rise to certain fallacious assumptions which, unlike
    the ordinary infractions of the laws of logic, are in a sense
    natural outgrowths of the evolution of thought (not without
    analogy to the organic diseases incident to bodily life) and
    may be termed structural fallacies of the intellect. These
    assumptions are:

    “1. That every concept is the counterpart of a distinct
    objective reality, and that hence there are as many things, or
    natural classes of things, as there are concepts or notions.

    “2. That the more general or extensive concepts and the
    realities corresponding to them pre-exist to the less general,
    more comprehensive, concepts and their corresponding realities;
    and that the latter concepts and realities are derived from
    the former, either by a successive addition of attributes or
    properties, or by a process of evolution, the attributes or
    properties of the former being taken as implications of those
    of the latter.

    “3. That the order of the genesis of concepts is identical with
    the order of the genesis of things.

    “4. That things exist independently of and antecedently to
    their relations; that all relations are between absolute terms;
    and that therefore whatever reality belongs to the properties
    of things is distinct from that of the things themselves.”

The differences between this procedure and that proper to the third (or
scientific) direction need hardly be enumerated.

Here the advance is step by step, without for an instant losing hold of
the thread that leads back to the starting-point of experience. Even
where the mind takes giant strides, or leaps across the intermediate
generalisations, it pauses to verify its results and to take up the
thread it had loosed for the moment. This is the typical process. Since
it formed the basis of our discussion of the intermediate and higher
forms of abstraction, we need not here return to it. Yet in conclusion,
it is well to recall once more what makes it of sterling value.

To reduce the essentials of abstraction and generalisation to the
exclusive use of the word (or sign) as is customary, is an error that
can only be explained by the time-honored neglect of the function of
the _unconscious_ in psychology. The sign is no more than an instrument
of simplification, an abbreviated formula. When the mind works with the
aid of concepts, the co-operation of two factors, the one conscious,
the other unconscious or subconscious, is required, in order that its
labor may be legitimate and fruitful: on the one hand, we have words or
signs, accompanied sometimes by a vague representation; on the other
hand, a latent, potential, organised knowledge. We endeavored above (Ch.
IV.) to show how this _couple_ forms and fixes itself. The mechanism is
invariably the same, without exception. Whether we keep up a trivial
conversation by means of the abstract terms which compose our languages,
or whether we ascend to the highest generalisations, there is in the
mental state no more than a difference in degree; there is no difference
in nature. Beneath the words that are the clear factors, exists the dumb
travail, the vague invocation, of the organised experience that gives
life to them. Without this unconscious factor which may, often does,
become conscious, there is nought but illusion. When we induct, deduct,
traverse a long series of abstractions to demonstrate or to discover, the
useful work consists in new relations which establish themselves in our
organised potential knowledge; words are no more than the instruments
that commence the task, facilitate and mark its phases. When the mind
is grappling with the highest abstractions, and climbs from height to
height, what preserves it from catastrophe, and guarantees against error,
is the quantity and quality of the unconscious material stored up
beneath the words. The entomologist who at first sight, and immediately,
classifies one insect among millions of species, acts in virtue of
his long experience, impressed firmly in his memory with salient
characteristics: he proceeds from the sensory data to the name. In the
inverse operation, when he merely enunciates the name, all this acquired
knowledge is the substrate. The existence of these conscious-unconscious
couples is, so to speak, a rule in psychology: general ideas are but
a particular case, perhaps the least well-known: hence we previously
likened them (Ch. IV.) to _mental habits_.

It follows that in proportion as we ascend in generalisation we rise,
not into vacuity, as has been said, but into the simple—as also, it
must be confessed, into the approximate. The relatively empty concepts
(there are none that are absolutely void of content) are the product
of a discontinuous generalisation which prevents descent without
interruption or omission into the concrete. Of course these are chiefly
encountered in the world of pure speculation. They are names representing
a knowledge that is incomplete, partial, inadequate, or ill-organised;
they correspond not to elimination of what is useless, but to deficit of
what is necessary. Having no possible contact with reality, they float
in an unreal atmosphere, and are material for a fragile and quickly
crumbling architecture. The aim of thinking by concepts is to substitute
for complex states, simpler conditions that may be turned and re-turned
in every possible sense, in order the better to discover their relations:
whereas here, by the nature of things, the unconscious activity, the
labor that operates silently in the lower strata, is applied to a soil
that is full of faults and fissures, and can but project a false light
into consciousness.

It has frequently been stated that symbolic thought is thinking by
substitution. This formula is admissible only when we recognise that
the substitute supposes, nay expects, the _actual_ existence of that
for which it is substituted. Substitution is valid in consciousness,
but not for the total operation. To sum up in a word: the psychology of
abstraction and generalisation, is in a great measure the _psychology of
the unconscious_.

We have merely studied general ideas in so far as they have an assignable
origin in experience, and do not transcend its limits. Are there, as some
maintain, notions anterior to any sensory intuition—that can by no means
nor effort be derived from empirical data? It is not our part to discuss
this question. The thesis—whether or no it be legitimate—is a contention
in favor of innate ideas, and in whatever fashion it is conceived (_à
priori_ forms, hereditary disposition, cerebral conformation), it is the
problem of the ultimate constitution of human intelligence, which we have
rigorously eliminated from our present subject.

[3] Schmidkunz, _loc. cit._ This author, who rightly insists upon the
positive character of abstraction (which is too frequently considered
as a negation) observes that no concept, not even that of infinity, is
in its psychological genesis the result of negation, for, “in order to
deduce from the idea of a finite thing the idea of infinity, it is first
necessary to abstract from that thing its quality of finality, which is
certainly a positive act; subsequently, in order to reach infinity, it
is sufficient either constantly to increase the time, magnitude, and
intensity of the finite, which is a positive process; or to deny the
limits of the finite, which is tantamount to denying the negation.”

more fundamental can possibly be assigned as a mark of intelligence than
the feeling of difference between consecutive or co-existing impressions.
“There are cases, however, where agreement imparts the shock requisite
for rousing the intellectual wave; but it is agreement so qualified as
to be really a mode of difference.” For a review and ample discussion
of this problem see Ladd’s _Psychology, Descriptive and Explanatory_,
Chapter XIV. The earlier psychologists, in considering the “faculty of
comparison” which acts by resemblance and difference, as primordial, had
observed the same fact, although they described it in different terms.

[9] This term is borrowed from the well-known works of Galton on
composite photographs, which are scarcely more than twenty years old.
Huxley in his book on Hume (Chapter IV.) appears to be the first who
introduced it into psychology, as shown by the following passage: “This
mental operation may be rendered comprehensible by considering what
takes place in the formation of compound photographs—when the images
of the faces of six sitters, for example, are each received on the
same photographic plate, for a sixth of the time requisite to take
one portrait. The final result is that all those points in which the
six faces agree are brought out strongly, while all those in which
they differ are left vague; and thus what may be termed a _generic_
portrait of the six is produced. Thus our ideas of single complex
impressions are incomplete in one way, and those of numerous, more or
less similar, complex impressions are incomplete in another way; that
is to say, they are generic.... And hence it follows that our ideas of
the impressions in question are not, in the strict sense of the word,
copies of those impressions; while at the same time they may exist in
the mind independently of language.” Romanes employs the word “recept”
for “generic images,” as marking their intermediate place between the
“percept” which is below, and the “concept” which is above them.

should, however, be remembered that the writer who thus uses the logic of
images has a mind preformed by the logic of signs: which is not the case
with animals.

[21] _Psychology_, II., 348 et seq. James, however, recalls the case
of another dog accustomed to find and carry wedges for splitting wood.
One day he did not return. After half an hour they looked for him; he
was biting and tearing at the handle of a hatchet stuck in a block
(the wedge was not forthcoming). Had this animal clear perception of
the common character of the two instruments used for splitting? “This
interpretation is possible, but it seems to me far to transcend the
limits of ordinary canine abstraction.” (_Loc. cit._, p. 352.) James
attempts another explanation. It is singular that he does not invoke
training, and association with man: that this is an influential factor
in the intellectual development of animals cannot be doubted. It is
advisable to adduce exclusively their spontaneous inventions, with no
possible suggestion: such facts alone are clear and convincing.

[22] Lloyd Morgan, whose tendencies have already been indicated,
distinguishes three sorts of inferences: (1) unconscious inference on
immediate construction (perceptual); (2) intelligent inference (conceded
to animals), dealing with constructs and reconstructs (perceptual); and
(3) rational inference, implying analysis and isolation (conceptual).

[29] Max Müller, however, is an exception. He has not made the smallest
concession on this point in any of his works, including the last
(_Three Lectures_, etc., cited above). He even maintains that a society
of deaf-mutes would hardly rise above the intellectual level of a
chimpanzee. “A man born dumb, notwithstanding his great cerebral mass
and his inheritance of strong intellectual instincts, would be capable
of few higher intellectual manifestations than an orang or a chimpanzee,
if he were confined to the society of dumb associates” (p. 92). This
thesis was attacked by thirteen critics, including Romanes, Galton, the
Duke of Argyle, etc., but Max Müller meets them all and replies to them
without flinching. It must be confessed that the arguments invoked by his
correspondents are very unequal in merit. Some are convincing, others
not. The Duke of Argyle says happily that “words are necessary to the
progress of thought, but not at all to the _act_ of thinking.” Ebbels (p.
13, appendix) shows that Max Müller has unduly limited the question by
excluding all processes anterior to the formation of concepts; we think
in images; the transition from one form to another is imperceptible,
and the faculty of abstraction does not appear suddenly along with the
signs. On the other hand, we cannot admit as evidence the facts invoked
by other correspondents, e. g., chess-players who combine and calculate
solely by the aid of visual images; answers to letters, conceived in the
first place as a general plan before they are developed in words, etc. It
is forgotten that the persons capable of these operations have had long
practice in verbal analysis, thereby attaining a high intellectual level.
So, in the physical order, the practical gymnast, even when not executing
any particular feat, possesses a suppleness and agility of body, due to
exercise, which translates itself into all his movements.

[30] _De l’Education des sourds-muets_, 2 vol., 1827. Notwithstanding
its somewhat remote date, the book has lost none of its interest in this
particular. It must also be remembered that institutions for deaf-mutes
are far more numerous now than at the beginning of the century, and
that the children are placed in them much earlier. Formerly they were
abandoned to themselves or instructed very late; in proportion to their
age, they presented better material for the study of their development.

[53] How were primitive terms (roots or words) formed? A much-debated and
still unsolved question. Man had at his disposal one primary element, the
interjection. By all accounts this remained sterile, unfertile; it did
not give birth to words; it remained in articulate language as a mark
of its emotional origin. A second proceeding was that of imitation with
the aid of sound, onomatopœia. From antiquity to the present time, it
has been regarded as the parent, _par excellence_. This was accepted by
Renan, Whitney, Tylor, H. Paul, etc.; rejected by M. Müller, Bréal, P.
Regnaud, etc. No one disputes the formation of many words by onomatopœia,
but those who question its value as a universal process say that “if in
certain sounds of our idioms we seem to hear an imitation of the sounds
of nature, we must recollect that the same noises are represented by
quite different sounds in other languages, which are also held by those
who utter them to be onomatopœia. Thus it would be more just to say
that we hear the sounds of nature through the words to which our ear
has been accustomed from infancy” (Bréal). I have observed that those
who study the spontaneous formation of language in children, claim
for them but little onomatopœism. On the other hand, a word created
by undoubted onomatopœia is sometimes by means of association, or of
strange analogies, transferred successively to so many objects that all
trace of the transformations of meaning may be lost, and the imitative
origin actually denied. Such was Darwin’s case, cited above, where the
onomatopœia of the duck finally served to designate all liquids, all that
flies, all pieces of money. If the successive extensions of the term had
not been observed, who could have recovered its origin?

[54] Sayce, _loc. cit._, IV., §§ 3-5.

[55] We cannot doubt, however, that there is in the child (and so too for
primitive man) a period of pure and simple denomination, when, in the
face of perceived objects, he utters a word, as a spontaneous action,
a reflex, with no understood affirmation. But this act is rather the
prelude, and attempt at speech, an advance towards language proper.

[56] There is in Iroquois a word that signifies, “I demand money from
those who have come to buy garments from me.” Esquimaux is equally rich
in terms of this sort. Yet we must recognise that these immense composite
words, themselves formed from abbreviated and fused words, virtually
imply the beginning of decomposition.

[60] We can see how little the _real_ order of evolution resembles the
theoretical order of the XVIII. century, evolved from pure reasoning:
“The complex notions of substances were the _first_ known, since they
came from the senses, and must therefore have been the first to have
names” (Condillac). “With regard to adjectives, the notion must have
developed with _exceeding difficulty_, since every adjective is an
abstract term, and abstraction is a painful, or unnatural operation” (J.
J. Rousseau).

[61] P. Regnaud, _Origine et philosophie du langage_, p. 317.

[62] On this point, consult especially Sayce, _op. cit._, II., § 9, and
P. Regnaud, _op. cit._, pp. 296-299.

[63] “The word _être_ is irreducible, indecomposable, primitive, and
wholly intellectual. I know no language in which the French word _être_
is expressed by a corresponding word representing a sensible idea. Hence
it is not true that all the roots of the language are in last resort
signs of sensory ideas.” (V. Cousin, _Histoire de la phil. au XIII
siècle_, 1841, II., p. 274.)

[64] For the psychology of relation consult Herbert Spencer,
_Psychology_, I., p. 65, II., pp., 360 et seq.; James, _Psychology_,
I., pp., 203 et seq. The latter gives the history of the subject,
which is very brief, and remarks that the idealogues form an honorable
exception to the general abstention. Thus Destutt de Tracy established a
distinction between feelings of _sensation_ and feelings of _relation_.

[66] It is superfluous to give examples of such a well-known fact. See
Darmesteter, _The Life of Words_.

[67] Intelligence is taken here in its restricted sense, as the synonym
of abstracting, generalising, judging, reasoning.

[71] As Paulhan remarks, “L’abstraction et les idées abstraites”
(_Revue Philosophique_, Jan., 1889, p. 26 et seq.), these two processes
are initially linked one with the other, so that we find analytical
syntheses, and synthetical analyses.

[72] _Op. cit._, VIII., 158-165.

[73] We have touched on this subject incidentally in _La psychologie
des sentiments_ (Part II, IX, § 2, pp. 305 et seq.). Many tribes do
not get beyond polydemonism, peopling the universe with innumerable
genii; this is the reign of the concrete. A certain progress is marked
by subordinating the genius of each tree to the god of the forest, the
different genii of a river to the god of the river, etc. At a degree
higher, the intellect constitutes a single god for water, one for fire,
one for the earth, etc. Thus there come to be genii of individual,
specific, and generic origin.

[74] Tylor, _Primitive Culture_, I., gives abundant data on this
question. Chap. VII. is entirely devoted to it.

[75] In the account of his travels among the Damaras (in his _Tropical
South Africa_, p. 133) Galton says: “In practice, whatever they may
possess in their language, they certainly use no numeral greater than
three. When they wish to express four, they take to their fingers, which
are to them as formidable instruments of calculation as a sliding-rule
is to our English schoolboy. They puzzle very much after five, because
no spare hand remains to grasp and secure the fingers that are required
for ‘units,’—yet they seldom lose oxen: the way in which they discover
the loss of one, is not by the number of the herd being diminished, but
by the absence of a face they know.” [This tallies with what we said
above, Chap. I., as to so-called numeration in animals and children.]
“When bartering is going on, each sheep must be paid for separately. Thus
suppose two sticks of tobacco to be the rate of exchange for one sheep,
it would sorely puzzle a Damara to take two sheep and give him four
sticks. I have done so and seen a man first put two of the sticks apart
and take a sight over them at one of the sheep he was about to sell.
Having satisfied himself that one was honestly paid for, and finding
to his surprise that exactly two sticks remained in hand to settle the
account for the other sheep, he would be afflicted with doubts; the
transaction seemed to come out too pat to be correct, and he would refer
back to the first couple of sticks, and then his mind got hazy and
confused, and wandered from one sheep to the other, and he broke off the
transaction until two sticks were put into his hand and one sheep driven
away, and then the other two sticks given him and the second sheep driven
away.” Galton relates many other similar facts which he had himself
witnessed.

[77] Wundt (_Logik_, I., pp. 113 et seq.) gives what he regards as a
complete classification of concepts, but it does not correspond with our
design. It may be summarised as follows. Four classes: I. Identical or
equivalent concepts; Aristotle = Alexander’s tutor. II. Subordinate or
superordinate concepts; mammals and vertebrates, etc. III. Co-ordinated
concepts, comprising five species: i. Disjunctive concepts; sound and
noise, French and German, etc. They are subordinate to a larger concept.
ii. Correlative concepts, with reciprocal relations; men and women,
mountain and valley. iii. Contrary concepts; high and low, good and
bad. iv. Contingent concepts; such, i. e., as touch, with very minute,
perceptible differences; this highly important category comprises
numbers. v. Interferent concepts, which coincide or partially cross;
negro and slave, rectangle and parallelogram. IV. Concepts which are
interdependent; etc., space and movement, crime and punishment, demand
and supply, labor and wages. This table may suit the logician but not
the psychologist, because it presents the concepts under what may be
termed the static order, i. e., ready formed: we, on the other hand,
are considering them as dynamic, i. e., in their becoming and order of
genesis.

[78] For details, with quotations in point, consult Agassiz: _De
l’espèce_, Chap. III., and E. Perrier, _La Philosophie zoologique avant
Darwin_, Chap. II.

[79] Agassiz, _op. cit._, gives a summary of the successive improvements.
They are of interest not merely to the zoölogist, but also from our own
point of view, as showing the increasing preponderance of analysis, and
search for fundamental characteristics, to the exclusion of the external
resemblances which served as basis for the more primitive classifications.

[80] Under the heading “Observations on General Terms” the _American
Journal of Psychology_, III. i, p. 144 (Jan., 1890) gives the results of
an investigation conducted upon 113 school children aged 13 to 18. The
words _being_, _the infinite_, _literature_, _abstraction_, _number_,
_play_, _coldness_, _horror_, etc., were written down, and a few moments
were given the pupils to transcribe their impressions in each case.

The summarised answers are not devoid of interest, but the object of the
inquiry is evidently very different from our own.

[81] The word “law” was purposely chosen for its ambiguity; physical
laws, moral or social laws. The immense majority of answers were in the
juristic sense. Ex., Code, Law of the Twelve Tables, a judge, woman with
scales, etc.

[82] For the word _infinity_, those who fall under this type see the
printed word, or the mathematical sign ∞.

[83] It should be noted that he lived among these animals and
experimented with them almost daily.

[84] The results of the investigation were published, partly in the
_Revue Philosophique_, October, 1891, partly at the International
Congress of Psychology, second session, London, 1892 (_International
Congress of Experimental Psychology._ London: Williams & Norgate, pp. 20,
et seq.).

[85] Thus Taine, who is usually regarded as a Nominalist, tells us
that, “A general idea is a name, nothing more than a name, a name which
_signifies_ and _comprehends_ a sequence of similar facts, or class
of similar individuals, accompanied usually by the sensory but vague
representation of some of these facts or individuals.” (The words
italicised for emphasis are not so distinguished in the text.)

[86] We are dealing only with comprehension, and not with invention
(discovery of a law, or of general features in nature). Invention
requires quite different mental processes.

[91] Maclellan & Dewey (_Psychology of Number and Its Application to
Methods of Teaching Arithmetic_, New York, 1895) made pedagogical
deductions from this fact. They ask, for beginners, that the examples
should be borrowed from continuous quantity, and that number be
considered as a particular species of measure.—In his book _Our Notions
of Number and Space_ (Boston, 1894) Nichols, taking a theory of James
about judgments of number as the basis of his experiments, tries to
show that the simultaneous sensation of two points applied to the skin
originates in the successive sensation of a distinct contact upon two
separate tactile circles.

[92] I do not insist on any such rash thesis. A discussion of it will be
found in the _Report of the Int. Congress of Exp. Psychol. in London_
(_cit._, pp. 35-41).

[94] Liard, _La science positive et la métaphysique_, p. 226. It should
be remarked that the process by subtraction is met with even among
uncivilised people, though very rarely. The plan of making numerals by
subtraction, says Tylor (_op. cit._, I., p. 264), is known in North
America, and is well shown in the Aino language of Yesso, where the words
for 8 and 9 obviously mean “two from ten,” “one from ten.”

[95] “The childish and savage practice of counting on the fingers and
toes lies at the foundation of our arithmetical science. Ten seems
the most convenient arithmetical basis offered by systems founded
on hand-counting, but twelve would have been better, and duodecimal
arithmetic is in fact a protest against the less convenient decimal
arithmetic in ordinary use. The case is the not uncommon one of high
civilisation bearing evident traces of the rudeness of its origin in
ancient barbaric life.” (Tylor, _loc. cit._, I. p. 272)

[100] This is not the place to enter into the well-known discussion
between the “nativists” and the “empiricists.” To the former all
sensation, visual or tactile, contains from its outset a _quantum_ of
extension which is the primitive element, and the foundation for our
spatial constructions. For the others there are only local signs, tactile
or visual, and movements whose synthesis suffices to constitute all the
modalities of existence. Whichever hypothesis be adopted, the extension
in point is always that given by concrete data (not that of space
conceived in the abstract)—directly cognised according to some, a genetic
construction according to others. This discussion has no direct relation
with our subject: for the full debate see Ribot’s _Psychologie allemande
contemporaine_, Ch. V. James (_Psychology_, II. Ch. XX.) has recently
taken up the nativistic theory, giving new arguments in its favor.

the author only reports the fact from another witness—that the narrator

[116] According to Delambre, the Chaldæans could only discover the
cycle which the Greek mathematicians called _saros_ by studying their
commemorative notes; i. e., from a considerable mass of observations,
they _extracted_ or _abstracted_ a constant recurrence.

[123] Romanes gives some examples of what he terms appreciation of
causality in animals, including that of a setter that was frightened
at thunder. “On one occasion a number of apples were being shot out of
bags upon the wooden floor of an apple room, the sound in the house as
each bag was shot closely resembled that of distant thunder. The setter
therefore became terribly alarmed; but when I took him to the apple-room
and showed him the real cause of the noise, his dread entirely forsook
him, and on again returning to the house he listened to the rumbling with
all cheerfulness.” Other analogous cases are to be found in his _Mental
Evolution in Animals_, Chap. X.

[124] For the study of Chance, see Cournot, _op. cit._, I., Chap. iii.
[Also J. Venn “The Logic of Chance,” etc.—_Tr._]

[125] Under the title _Zur Entwickelung von Kant’s Theorie der
Naturcausalität_, (_Philosophische Studien_, IX, 3 and 4), Wundt
gives us a rapid historical sketch. He holds that speculation, in
antiquity, is characterised by the method of contraries: the opposition
of being and becoming, etc. It is wholly qualitative. The ancients
progressed by definition. Elaboration of the concept of mechanical
causation was impossible, by reason of the absence of any quantitative
determination. This began with Galileo. The progress of mathematics,
and the introduction of fractional and irrational numbers made it
possible to search out, not merely measure, but also the relation between
magnitudes—i. e., _function_. This became the type, and at the same
time the goal of all intellectual elaboration, as applied to natural
phenomena. This method culminated in the seventeenth century, with the
predominance of the logical type. In consequence of the old concept of
substance, forces were taken as cause, phenomena as effect. The latter is
more frequently derived from cause by deduction, not by intuition. The
cause of a determined event might either be the total of its conditions,
or one antecedent event. This last conception prevailed, as being the
more favorable to the application of mathematics. The eighteenth century
marks the genesis of the biological sciences. The growing importance of
observation and experimental research made against the preponderance
of mathematics. The facts of experience were held more solid than the
conclusions of reason. The type of causality is placed no longer in
deduction, but in sensory intuition; it is the residuum of experience.
This tendency found its exponent in Hume. Kant endeavored to reconcile
the two theses; that which models object upon subject (seventeenth
century) and that which models subject upon object (eighteenth century).

[126] The question is sometimes raised as to whether psychical (and
consequently moral, social) facts ought to be included under the formula
of conservation of energy and correlation of forces. Since the only
evidence produced has been of the nature of theoretical affirmations, or
vague and partial experiences, without quantitative determination, the
question so far remains open. The concept of natural causality was in the
same way considered above in its positive sense, i. e., as a relation of
invariable sequence, without inquiring whether it extends to all forms of
experience,—or whether it is limited.

[127] W. James, _Psychology_, II., p. 671.

[128] Sigwart in his _Logik_, Book II. (English translation by
Helen Dendy) has made a profound study of the classification of the
psychological laws in psychology, and their relative value. He divides
them into three categories, according to the nature of the relations
which they express: 1. Psychophysical laws which formulate constant
relations between states of consciousness and the cerebral states. Ex.
the relation between the sensation directly received, and the image that
is reproduced in consciousness. 2. Psychological laws properly so-called;
these express the internal relations of the states of consciousness.
Ex. Law of conservation of impressions, law of association, law of
systematisation by volition. 3. Laws expressive of the reciprocal
action that human thoughts and volitions exert one upon the other: they
presuppose the intervention of social causes, and are to this day vague
and ill-determined; hence there are no fixed rules for the government of
humanity, or the bringing up of children.

[129] “Fundamental laws are, or should be, only the simplest, most
abridged, and most economical mode of expressing facts, within the limits
of precision possible to our observations and experiences. The laws of
nature are simple, essentially because—among all the possible modes of
expression—we choose the simplest” (see Mach, _Mechanics_, Chicago, 1893,
and _Popular Scientific Lectures_, 23d ed., Chicago, 1898, under the
headings “Economy of Thought,” “Law,” etc.). “In formulating a general,
simple, precise law, based upon relatively few experiences, which,
moreover, present certain divergencies, we only obey a necessity from
which the human mind cannot free itself.” (Poincaré.)

[130] Since our subject is the tracing out of the _concept_ of law in its
different degrees, starting from the generic image, we have no need to
study the nature of the laws proper to each science (logic, mathematics,
mechanics, physico-chemistry, biology, etc.), nor to discuss their value.
For this point, see Boutroux, _L’idée de loi naturelle dans la science et
la philosophie contemporaine_. Paris, 1895.

[131] Brown, quoted by Quatrefages (_Précurseurs de Darwin_, p. 218), who
adds, “If this were the case, one would not find many species denoted
by particular names among savages, and our own illiterate population.
The general notion of species is on the contrary one of those that are
forced upon us, directly we look round. The difficulty is to formulate
it clearly, to give it scientific precision, and this is a very real
problem.”

[132] Quatrefages (_op. cit._, pp. 219-222) gives a great number of
definitions of species. A few may be quoted: “Species should be defined
as a succession of wholly similar individuals, perpetuated by means of
generation” (De Jussieu).—“Species is a constant succession of like
individuals, which reproduce themselves” (Buffon).—“By species we mean
any collection of similar individuals, that have been produced by
individuals like unto themselves” (Lamarck).—“Species is the individual
repeated and continued in time and space” (Blainville).—“Species is the
totality of all individuals that have the same origin, and of those that
are as like them, as they are among themselves” (Brown), etc., etc.

[133] For the transformists, as is well known, variety, race, and species
are not fixed concepts. “From variety to race, from race to species,
there is a continuous insensible passage. Individual modifications, at
first slight, give rise to a variety or to a race. Continuing to augment,
and extending to a constantly increasing number of individuals, they
may come to constitute specific characters. Pursuing its evolution, the
species then finally reaches the rank of the genus, family, etc.”

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EVOLUTION OF GENERAL
IDEAS ***

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
